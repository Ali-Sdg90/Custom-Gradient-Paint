<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    At the core of this project is a complex yet user-friendly interface that
    allows you to explore the mesmerizing world of color gradients. The initial
    canvas greets you with a checkered pattern and a discreet settings button.
    Clicking on any block within the checkered canvas triggers a fascinating
    color gradient, starting from your selected block and gradually fading out
    across neighboring blocks.
